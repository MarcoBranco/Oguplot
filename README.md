__Oguplot Repository__
=====================================

Repository to contain source code and versions of the python
live plot project. Contains:

* Code
* Plan
* Workflow
* Research
* Features to be added

Current Issues:

The lists are growing!

These lines need to be replaced:

```python
	    data1.append(float(set1))
	    data2.append(float(set2))
```

These list just keep growing. Also, I'm appending floats which are very large
